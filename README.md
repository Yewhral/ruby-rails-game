# ruby-rails-game

This is my first personal project in Ruby on Rails.

It's purpose is to teach me RoR and have fun.
I plan to make it as a "game" where you can create an account, build your character and interact with other players or fight with monsters.

Rails version: 5.1.4

Ruby version: 2.4.1

Git config test
